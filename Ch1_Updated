// Introduction

Social Media like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn are on top priorities , as an operational presence for organisations,
small or large. Social Network Data can be categorized into
user demographics, link information and the content generated by various
users. Analysis of an individual categories itself delivers a large amount of
useful knowledge that can be used for commercial applications. One such
data analysis technique is Influence Analysis. Influence Analysis is a metric
to quantify the influence that certain social network users (influencers) have
over other social network users because of their knowledge and reputation on
a certain topic.This technique requires the analysis of links between users
which can be easily performed using  Graph Database.
Graph Databases are one of the largest growing categories in data man-
agement, yet they remain an enigma to many. Graph Databases are well-
suited for analysing interconnections, which is why there has been a lot of
interest in using graph databases to mine data.Neo4j Graph Database enables
us to treat relationships between data as equally important as the data it-
self and study the connection between users. It enables users to efficiently
traverse the graph structure and provides user friendly visualization of the
result.
