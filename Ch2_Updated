Overview 


Study of Social Network

Social networking is the use of internet-based social media programs to make
connections with friends, family, classmates, customers and clients. Social
networking can occur for social purposes, business purposes or both through
sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. Social networking is also a
significant target area for marketers seeking to engage users. With the rise of
the Internet and technology, Online Social Networks (OSNs) turned into chal-
lenging cases of study, on which big data content and complex interpersonal
ties among actors converge. A social network can be represented by a graph,
whose nodes can represent the users, and the edges the interpersonal ties
among them. By analyzing and mining social networks, we can gather infor-
mation on the comments people make with respect to a particular product.
Analysis of such comments shows its valuable for the design of marketing
and advertising campaigns.



Classification based on Social Network
Topology-based social networks 

• Online Social Networks 
They are virtual communities which allow people to connect and interact with each other
on a particular subject or to just “hang out” together online.
• Mobile social networks 
With the significant development of wireless network technologies (i.e. cellular network, WiFi, and Bluetooth),
web-based online social network applications have lead to a shift from
online networks to mobile networks.


Function-based social networks-
• Social news: A social news website features user-posted stories that are
ranked based on popularity
• Instant messaging (IM): IM is a type of online chat platform that pro-
vides real-time text transmission over the Internet.
• Microblogging: It allows users exchange small elements of content, such
as short sentences, individual images, or video links such asTwitter
is a microblogging platform, which allows registered users to publish
short text though multiple interfaces, including Web, SMS, and instant
messaging.
• Social bookmarking: It is a centralized online service that allows users
to add, edit, annotate, and share bookmarks of web documents, such
as StumbleUpon.
• Internet forum: It is an online discussion site where people can hold
conversations in the form of posted messages.
• Media sharing website: It allows users to upload, view, comment, and
share multiple dimensions information, such as files, videos, photos,
music, movie. For example YouTube.
• Social networking: It allows users to share ideas, posts, pictures, ac-
tivities, events, and interests with people in their network, such as
Facebook.

Social Network Data(SND)
Social Network Data is evolutionary which comes with characteristic such as
data are unstructured which comes in format like plain text, RDF, JSON,
makes it difficult for users to index or load such data in a database, also they
are noisy and heterogeneous in nature. Converting social network raw data
to the precise graph representation is crucial for data analytical framework
to make accurate decisions and predictions. When appropriately done, graph
can captures the essential aspects of the data and abstracts away the noisy,
irrelevant parts. Modelling the interactions between entities as graphs has
enabled to understand the various network systems in a systematic manner.

Social Influence Analysis
Social network influence pertains to the ability of a user to change the feelings,
attitudes, or behaviors of other users in a network.Social influence is the
impression that a person has on others or in other words, certain individuals
in a community or network influence other participants to form views on
several subjects and issues. These individuals are called as influencers, who
led the foundation of opinions, public knowledge and attitudes.

Advantages of social influence analysis
• In terms of sociology, it is helpful to understand people’s social behaviors
• In terms of public services, it is helpful to provide a theoretical basis for
public decision making and public opinion guidance
• In terms of country, it is also helpful to promote national security, eco-
nomic stability, economic progress, and so on.

Difficulties in social influence analysis
• Do not have a mathematical definition and measurement of social
influence.
• It is very difficult to decide the major factors for a specific case to social
influence modeling.
• There is no effective ways to properly integrate various factors for influ-
ence measurement
• It is hard to characterize the causal relationship of social influence, as well
as the uncertainty of social influence.
• Moreover, in a real-world social network, the influential users cannot be
determine without having prior knowledge of influential domain and
19even after achieving results, human intervention is needed to justify
those results.
• Human intervention is needed to justify those results even after achieving
results.


Categories of Influence Analysis

User Based Analysis

Users on social media are from various communities and background having
different taste and choices, while active on social networking sites. Finding
right user for specific analysis or recommendation can helps the organization
to better understand their customers. User based analysis mainly divided
into three categories-
• Group of users or community where peoples are grouped based on similar
interest.They are also related to each other based on some forehand
knowing criteria’s like any other communities in the real world e.g.
college group.
• Classification of users based on different characteristics such as behavior,
preferences, etc.
• Group of spammers.
As social networking sites do not give well-built authentication mechanisms,
and it is quite easy to masquerade as a user and creep into a person’s network
of trust whether he is friend or not known as spammers.


Link Based Analysis

Social networking sites can be formulated as graphs, where each vertex re-
flects as user and edges reflects as relationships between many users. So-
cial networking sites are active networks which changes dynamically with
time, incoming new vertexes and edges are regularly combined with existing
graphs. To explore relation based structural analysis which mainly based
on link prediction, influence analysis, community discovery using correlation
20links, social tie prediction as well as tie strength prediction, etc. Link pre-
diction used to predict the probable forthcoming connection between two
vertexes.


Content Based Analysis

Social media and networking sites contains textual data in the form of mes-
sages, opinions, multimedia data such as images, videos, locations etc. Al-
most every content analysis such as data analysis, text analysis, and mul-
timedia analysis can be translated to social media analytics. In general,
content analysis can be define as process of summarizing, quantitative analy-
sis of messages or text that relies on the scientific method includes attention
to objectivity,inter-subjectivity, apriori design, reliability, validity, generaliz-
ability, replicability, and hypothesis testing.


The influence analysis on social network can be perform on either entire
network-
• Global influence take considers overall action of the whole social network
with the goal of finding the most influential users in an entire network. For
example, consider a phenomenon that detects influencers users based on the
criteria of most number of followers across the whole Twitter network(i.e.,
global indegree).
• Local influence take into account the actions of either a topic or group/community
with the goal of finding the most influential user based on the criteria of
member with most number of followers who belongs to particular topic or
group/community(local indegree).

Application of Influence Analysis

//image of influence analysis

• Viral Marketing : Influence dissemination patterns are useful in under-
standing the specific reasons behind the rapid adoption of certain in-
novations. Patterns help marketers and advertisers implement effective
campaigns. Viral marketing depends on the assumption that the pur-
chasing decisions of a user are heavily influenced by the suggestions
and recommendations of friends in social networks.
• Political Movements : Politicians in modern democracies worldwide have
eagerly adopted OSN platforms to engage with users, specifically during
election campaigns. Results have shown that the statement influenced
the actual voting behavior of millions of people.
• News Spreading : The OSNs have become significant channels for broad-
casting and collecting news. Influential news broadcasters can be cat-
egorized into 3 groups: individuals associated with the media, grass-
roots or ordinary users, and celebrities. Official media sources reach
the majority of OSN (Twitter) users and spread most headlines daily.
Opinion leaders and celebrities can reach users distant from the core of
the network.
• Health Applications : Online social media platforms have also become sub-
stantial sources of health data. OSN website users discuss numerous
common interest topics, including health issues. For instance, Twitter
is used by patients and doctors to share their personal feelings and
experiences. Furthermore, OSNs comprise several
health communities that aim to address the concerns of patients or
users regarding various diseases.
• Spread of Opinions : Posts from influential users with influential friends
would be acknowledged and expanded at a very high rate by their
followers and may rapidly spread in the network through information
dissemination. Opinion formation is the result of information dissem-
ination among OSN users through the communication and discussion
of opinions, views, and beliefs about specific topics.
• Corporate Communication : OSN users have an accumulative influence on
the business reputation of organizations. Influential users of OSNs can
spread positive or negative posts or opinions on services or products to
other OSN users. This process can significantly affect the reputation of
an organization because a post within an OSN can spread to numerous
users.
• Spread of Natural Disaster Situation Awareness : OSN platforms are abun-
dant and real-time information sources relative to real-world events,
especially during mass crises. Valuable information from OSNs can
provide significant insights into time-critical situations for the effective
and timely analysis of the hazards of current emergencies and activities.
• Rumor Restraint Rumors cause significant social damage. Rumors have
received considerable research attention in the literature on OSNs, in
which recent studies have demonstrated their rapid spread in the OSN
context.
