Overview 


Study of Social Network

Social networking is the use of internet-based social media programs to make
connections with friends, family, classmates, customers and clients. Social
networking can occur for social purposes, business purposes or both through
sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. Social networking is also a
significant target area for marketers seeking to engage users. With the rise of
the Internet and technology, Online Social Networks (OSNs) turned into chal-
lenging cases of study, on which big data content and complex interpersonal
ties among actors converge. A social network can be represented by a graph,
whose nodes can represent the users, and the edges the interpersonal ties
among them. By analyzing and mining social networks, we can gather infor-
mation on the comments people make with respect to a particular product.
Analysis of such comments shows its valuable for the design of marketing
and advertising campaigns.
