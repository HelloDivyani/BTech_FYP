Overview 


Study of Social Network

Social networking is the use of internet-based social media programs to make
connections with friends, family, classmates, customers and clients. Social
networking can occur for social purposes, business purposes or both through
sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. Social networking is also a
significant target area for marketers seeking to engage users. With the rise of
the Internet and technology, Online Social Networks (OSNs) turned into chal-
lenging cases of study, on which big data content and complex interpersonal
ties among actors converge. A social network can be represented by a graph,
whose nodes can represent the users, and the edges the interpersonal ties
among them. By analyzing and mining social networks, we can gather infor-
mation on the comments people make with respect to a particular product.
Analysis of such comments shows its valuable for the design of marketing
and advertising campaigns.



Classification based on Social Network
Topology-based social networks 

• Online Social Networks 
They are virtual communities which allow people to connect and interact with each other
on a particular subject or to just “hang out” together online.
• Mobile social networks 
With the significant development of wireless network technologies (i.e. cellular network, WiFi, and Bluetooth),
web-based online social network applications have lead to a shift from
online networks to mobile networks.


Function-based social networks-
• Social news: A social news website features user-posted stories that are
ranked based on popularity
• Instant messaging (IM): IM is a type of online chat platform that pro-
vides real-time text transmission over the Internet.
• Microblogging: It allows users exchange small elements of content, such
as short sentences, individual images, or video links such asTwitter
is a microblogging platform, which allows registered users to publish
short text though multiple interfaces, including Web, SMS, and instant
messaging.
• Social bookmarking: It is a centralized online service that allows users
to add, edit, annotate, and share bookmarks of web documents, such
as StumbleUpon.
• Internet forum: It is an online discussion site where people can hold
conversations in the form of posted messages.
• Media sharing website: It allows users to upload, view, comment, and
share multiple dimensions information, such as files, videos, photos,
music, movie. For example YouTube.
• Social networking: It allows users to share ideas, posts, pictures, ac-
tivities, events, and interests with people in their network, such as
Facebook.

Social Network Data(SND)
Social Network Data is evolutionary which comes with characteristic such as
data are unstructured which comes in format like plain text, RDF, JSON,
makes it difficult for users to index or load such data in a database, also they
are noisy and heterogeneous in nature. Converting social network raw data
to the precise graph representation is crucial for data analytical framework
to make accurate decisions and predictions. When appropriately done, graph
can captures the essential aspects of the data and abstracts away the noisy,
irrelevant parts. Modelling the interactions between entities as graphs has
enabled to understand the various network systems in a systematic manner.

Social Influence Analysis
Social network influence pertains to the ability of a user to change the feelings,
attitudes, or behaviors of other users in a network.Social influence is the
impression that a person has on others or in other words, certain individuals
in a community or network influence other participants to form views on
several subjects and issues. These individuals are called as influencers, who
led the foundation of opinions, public knowledge and attitudes.

Advantages of social influence analysis
• In terms of sociology, it is helpful to understand people’s social behaviors
• In terms of public services, it is helpful to provide a theoretical basis for
public decision making and public opinion guidance
• In terms of country, it is also helpful to promote national security, eco-
nomic stability, economic progress, and so on.

Difficulties in social influence analysis
• Do not have a mathematical definition and measurement of social
influence.
• It is very difficult to decide the major factors for a specific case to social
influence modeling.
• There is no effective ways to properly integrate various factors for influ-
ence measurement
• It is hard to characterize the causal relationship of social influence, as well
as the uncertainty of social influence.
• Moreover, in a real-world social network, the influential users cannot be
determine without having prior knowledge of influential domain and
19even after achieving results, human intervention is needed to justify
those results.
• Human intervention is needed to justify those results even after achieving
results.
