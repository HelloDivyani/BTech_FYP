Introduces
In addition, this chapter overview various available approaches to overcome those challenges and discusses the problem of finding influential nodes from a given social network. Chapter 2 gave detailed survey of approaches and techniques for social network analysis, ranking nodes and influence analysis. Chapter 3 mainly focused on proposed approach which includes two algorithm i.e. WEFFR and WEFFRPR for analyzing influence of nodes in evolving social network data. Chapter 4 demonstrates various experimental analysis and performance comparison of proposed algorithms with traditional Page Rank and Betweenness centrality approach. Chapter 5 concludes the contributions of proposed work and highlighted several possible directions for future research.
