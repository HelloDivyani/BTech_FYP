#Introduction 
Graph Databases are one of the largest growing categories in data management, yet they remain an enigma to many. Graph Databases are well-suited for analysing interconnections, which is why there has been a lot of interest in using graph databases to mine data. The most commonly used source for this purpose is Social Media. Social Media like Facebook, Twitter , LinkedIn are on top priorities , as an operational presence for organisations, small or large. Analysis of these evolutionary networks is challenging and is currently a topic of research.
Social Network Data can be categorized into user demographics, link information and the content generated by various users. Analysis of an individual categories itself delivers a large amount of useful knowledge that can be used for commercial applications. One such data analysis technique is Influence Analysis.
Influence Analysis is a metric to quantify the influence that certain social network users (influencers) have over other social network users because of their knowledge and reputation on a certain topic. This technique requires the analysis of links between users which can be easily performed using Neo4j Graph Database. Neo4j enables us to treat relationships between data as equally important as the data itself and study the connection between users. It enables users to efficiently traverse the graph structure and provides user friendly visualization of the result.

1.4 Organisation of Report
This report is organizes as follows :
chapter 1 : 
Introduces
In addition, this chapter overview various available approaches to overcome those challenges and discusses the problem of finding influential nodes from a given social network. Chapter 2 gave detailed survey of approaches and techniques for social network analysis, ranking nodes and influence analysis. Chapter 3 mainly focused on proposed approach which includes two algorithm i.e. WEFFR and WEFFRPR for analyzing influence of nodes in evolving social network data. Chapter 4 demonstrates various experimental analysis and performance comparison of proposed algorithms with traditional Page Rank and Betweenness centrality approach. Chapter 5 concludes the contributions of proposed work and highlighted several possible directions for future research.
