What is graph databse : 
A graph is an abstract data type typically used to model data that contains objects (referred to as nodes or vertices), and some sort of relationship between those objects (lines or edges).

A graph database is essentially a collection of nodes and edges. 
Each node represents an entity (such as a person or business) and each edge represents a connection or relationship between two nodes. 
Every node in a graph database is defined by a unique identifier, a set of outgoing edges and/or incoming edges and a set of properties expressed as key/value pairs.
Each edge is defined by a unique identifier, a starting-place and/or ending-place node and a set of properties.

These properties correspond to the columns in a relational database.
Edges are use to describe the relationships between the objects contained in the database, 
and in most they can be compared to the foreign key column of a row in a RDBMS.
Graph database is a nosql database structure.

Why Graph Databases?

We live in a connected world! There are no isolated pieces of information, but rich, connected domains all around us.
Most of the data exists in the form of the relationship between different objects and more often, 
the relationship between the data is more valuable than the data itself. 
Only a database that natively embraces relationships is able to store, process, and query connections efficiently.
While other databases compute relationships at query time through expensive JOIN operations, 
a graph database stores connections alongside the data in the model.

Accessing nodes and relationships in a native graph database is an efficient, constant-time operation and allows 
you to quickly traverse millions of connections per second per core.

Independent of the total size of your dataset, graph databases excel at managing highly-connected data and complex queries
. With only a pattern and a set of starting points, graph databases explore the neighboring data around those initial starting points — collecting and aggregating information from millions of nodes and relationships — and leaving any data outside the search perimeter untouched.
Graph databases, by design, allow simple and fast retrieval of complex hierarchical structures that are difficult to 
model in relational systems. 


1.3 Graph as NoSQL Structure : 

NoSQL means Not Only SQL, is a whole new way of thinking about a database.
It is an approach to  non-relational data management and database design that’s useful for
 distributed data stores where very large scale of unstructured data storing needs.
 It encompasses a wide range of technologies and architectures.
 

1.3.1 Brewer’s CAP theorem 
CAP theorem — Relates to NoSQL

CAP theorem tries to demonstrate the properties expected by a NoSQL database. 
Most of the databases are designed to achieve two of these properties at the cost of another property.

C — Consistency

When performing an operation you always have to receive the same information, regardless the node that process the order. It means that no matter which node that forms our Database receives an order, everyone must respond to the operation equally and must be transparent to us who effected it. All clients see the same version of data.

A — Availability
The system provides answers for all requests it receives, even if one or more nodes are down.

P — Partition tolerance

The system still Works even though it has been divided by a network failure.


1.3.2 Types of NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases are guaranteed to adhere to two of the CAP properties. Such databases are of several types.

    Key-Value Store — Stores in the form of a hash table {Example- Riak, Amazon S3 (Dynamo), Redis}
   example-
    Key	    Value
    “India”	{“B-25, Sector-58, Noida, India – 201301”
    
    Document-based Store — Stores objects, mostly JSON, which is web friendly or supports ODM (Object Document Mappings). {Example- CouchDB, MongoDB}
     
    {officeName:”3Pillar Noida”, 
    {Street: “B-25, City:”Noida”, State:”UP”, Pincode:”201301”}
     }
     
    Column-based Store — Each storage block contains data from only one column {Example- HBase, Cassandra}
    //image p1 will be here
    
    Graph-based — Graph representation of relationships, mostly used by social networks. {Example- Neo4J}
    //image person-city will be here

The trouble to visualise the relationship between entities in a Relational Database is a 
is overcomed with the help of graphical representation of graph databases.
The most modern Graph Databases also offer advantages in performance, since they use NoSQL based storage mechanisms. 
In this way, these databases became scalable and can be distributed to several processing cores in the cloud.
The most popular Graph Databases with this kind of approach are Neo4J, OrientDB and TitanDB.



2.1 What is Neo4j?

Neo4J is the first and most popular native Graph Database according to DB Engines website
Neo4j is an open-source implemented in Java ,it has its own query language called Cypher and  provides an ACID-compliant transactional backend for applications.
In native graph storage data is stored as graph on disk, the unit is vertex and edge. 
Initial development of Neo4j began in 2003, but it has been publicly available since 2007. 

Some of the following particular features make Neo4j very popular among developers, architects, and DBAs:

    #Cypher, a declarative query language similar to SQL, but optimized for graphs.
           Now used by other databases like SAP HANA Graph and Redis graph via the openCypher project.
     #Constant time traversals in big graphs for both depth and breadth due to efficient representation of nodes and relationships.
              Enables scale-up to billions of nodes on moderate hardware.
    
    #Flexible property graph schema that can adapt over time, making it possible to materialize and add new relationships later to shortcut and speed up the domain data when the business needs change.
    
    # Drivers for popular programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, .NET, Python, and many more.
