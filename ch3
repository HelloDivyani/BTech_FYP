3.1 Exploration of Steps :

Step 1 :  Fetching Twitter Data
          Features of twitter are-
          1.A Twitter user's activity data (tweets, followers, etc) is all public by default
          2.Twitter's API allowed us to automatically download up to 20,000 data points per hour
          3.Twitter uses auto-incrementing ID numbers (1,2,3,4…) for both users and tweets
          
          Twitter’s API allows you to do complex queries like pulling every tweet about a certain topic within the 
          last twenty minutes, or pull a certain user’s non-retweeted tweets.
          
          Tools Overview- Python 2.7, Neo4j community 3.2.9,
                             python library- py2neo (toolkit for working with neo4j and python)
                                       tweepy ( to connect to Twitter’s API) 
                                       
          Twitter timeline data fetch
             We have  pulled the ten days recent tweets from your Twitter feed and hashtag of demonitization and Indian politics.
                    The pyhton script uses py2neo libraary , fetch the twitter data through 
                    tweepy and dump data in graph.db of neo4j.

Step 2 : Querying the data


MATCH (p:User)-[s:SENT]->(tweet:Message)-[retweet:FORWARD]->(tweet1:Message)
WITH p, COUNT(DISTINCT tweet) AS Retweets
MATCH  (p:User)-[s2:SENT]->(tweet2:Message)
WITH p, COUNT(DISTINCT tweet2) AS total,Retweets
RETURN p.id AS Username,total,Retweets,(total-Retweets)*1.0/total
