Step 1 :  Fetching Twitter Data
          Features of twitter are-
          1.A Twitter user's activity data (tweets, followers, etc) is all public by default
          2.Twitter's API allowed us to automatically download up to 20,000 data points per hour
          3.Twitter uses auto-incrementing ID numbers (1,2,3,4…) for both users and tweets
          
          Twitter’s API allows you to do complex queries like pulling every tweet about a certain topic within the 
          last twenty minutes, or pull a certain user’s non-retweeted tweets.
