3.1 Fetching Twitter Data and Integrating Neo4j with Frontend Technology

Features of twitter data are-
• A Twitter user’s activity data (tweets, followers, etc) is all public by
default.
• Twitter’s API allowed us to automatically download up to 20,000 data
points per hour.
• Twitter uses auto-incrementing ID numbers (1,2,3,4. . . ) for both users
and tweets.

Twitter’s Streaming API allows you to do complex queries like pulling every tweet
about a certain topic within the last twenty minutes, or pull a certain user’s
non-retweeted tweets.
